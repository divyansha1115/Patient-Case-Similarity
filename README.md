#### There may be more than one XML file for each patient, remember to concatenate them before running the code, the cat command will be of great use to you ...


• XSLT used for transforming and extracting annotated data into CSV. <p>
• An ensemble model consisting of both Word Mover’s Distance (WMD) and General Feature Extraction <p>
based on curated list of important sections were utilized in ratio 3:1.



Project for Grand Finale of Smart India Hackathon 2019 for the Problem statement by EzDI in which we made a system for assessment of similarity between patient using vector concatenation techniques and optimized WMD to foresee prognosis and hospitalization.
